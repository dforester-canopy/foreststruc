# Forest structure as a landscape 
## Overview {-}

This section I was thinking to think forest as a landscape ecology. Forest is not something just in a plot but is a whole mountain or landscape. It changes along different altitude and height too~~ So there are a lot can be discussed here but we are looking at its complexities. In terms of "HORIZONTAL" and "VERTICAL". 


## Horizontal complexities

All chapter sections start with a second-level (`##`) or higher heading followed by your section title, like the sections above and below here. You can have as many as you want within a chapter.

### An unnumbered section {-}

Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a `{.unnumbered}` or the shorter `{-}` at the end of the heading, like in this section.

How to create a metric table
```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(pressure, 10), caption = 'Should be a metric table',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```


## Vertical variations
