Welcome! 

This is a e-book that I had created just to have an overview of what people had created and understand forest structure, its architecture, complexity and how is being measured :evergreen_tree::tent:. 

I hope it will be helpful cause I realized that there are lots of people using all the metrics around the globe and to be honest I am still quite confused about the concept myself too. So I wrote this to summarized what I had read and hopefully everyone will also benefit from it. 

At the moment I am not focusing on the application of functions of each type of functions yet cause it will meke the goal of this e-book so much more complex. 

Hope that everyone enjoys it. If you have any comments please let me know by sending an email to dtc40@cam.ac.uk and I am very happy to discuss with everyone.
