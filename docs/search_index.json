Thinking about the application of it its going to be tiring but whatever. I think itself can be written into a review paper tho (to be honest). and yeah after caterotization it can be categorized into so so so much. My thoughts right now is like below: 7.1 Environments of Forests 7.1.1 microclimates 7.1.1.1 carbon 7.1.1.2 water 7.1.2 biogeochemical 7.2 Dynamics of Forests 7.2.1 regeneration (growth) 7.2.2 disturbances 7.2.2.1 fires 7.2.2.2 pests…etc 7.3 Biodiversity 7.3.1 habitat etc birs and animals? Who knows 7.4 Equations Here is an equation. \\[\\begin{equation} f\\left(k\\right) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k\\left(1-p\\right)^{n-k} \\tag{7.1} \\end{equation}\\] You may refer to using \\@ref(eq:binom), like see Equation (7.1). 7.5 Theorems and proofs Labeled theorems can be referenced in text using \\@ref(thm:tri), for example, check out this smart theorem 7.1. Theorem 7.1 For a right triangle, if \\(c\\) denotes the length of the hypotenuse and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) denote the lengths of the other two sides, we have \\[a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\] Read more here https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html. 7.6 Callout blocks The R Markdown Cookbook provides more help on how to use custom blocks to design your own callouts: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/custom-blocks.html "]]
