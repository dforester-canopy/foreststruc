This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files.

Which is what is forest structure? There are quite a lot of arguments and various concepts of what “forest structure” should be and how should it be measured. However is that true? So in this book I will try my best to basically summarize the existing concepts and how people are recently categorized and measure the different metrices and descriptions of complexity index around the globe. This is just be a list of everything tho. How its going to be applied in different industries are still yet being decided tho. Hope everyone enjoys. 2.1 Scale dependency of Forests canopies Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter must start with a first-level heading: # A good chapter, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: ## A short section or ### An even shorter section. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. 2.2 Render book You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: Find the Build pane in the RStudio IDE, and Click on Build Book, then select your output format, or select “All formats” if you’d like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. Or build the book from the R console: This book documents the methods and workflow used in my PhD project bah bah bah "],["forest-structure-as-a-landscape.html", "Chapter 3 Forest structure as a landscape 3.1 Horizontal complexities 3.2 Vertical variations", " Chapter 3 Forest structure as a landscape All chapters start with a first-level heading followed by your chapter title, like the line above. There should be only one first-level heading (#) per .Rmd file. 3.1 Horizontal complexities All chapter sections start with a second-level (##) or higher heading followed by your section title, like the sections above and below here. You can have as many as you want within a chapter. An unnumbered section Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a {.unnumbered} or the shorter {-} at the end of the heading, like in this section. 3.2 Vertical variations "],["forest-as-the-indivitual.html", "Chapter 4 Forest as the indivitual 4.1 Chapters and sub-chapters 4.2 Captioned figures and tables", " Chapter 4 Forest as the indivitual Cross-references make it easier for your readers to find and link to elements in your book. 4.1 Chapters and sub-chapters There are two steps to cross-reference any heading: Label the heading: # Hello world {#nice-label}. Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter ??. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 4.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively. See Figure 4.1. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 4.1: Here is a nice figure!

Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. Add a numbered part: # (PART) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an unnumbered part: # (PART\\*) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: # (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-} (followed by # A chapter).

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2025) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key.
